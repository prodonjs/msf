                        Over the past decade, our full-service commercial real estate mortgage banking firm has tripled

                        investment real estate properties throughout the United States. We have accomplished this
                        incredible growth through continual emphasis on increasing and strengthening our lender

                        Mortgage loan servicing has become an integral component of MS&F, as most correspondent lending
                        relationships have had increased demands placed on them by rating and regulatory agencies. We
                        currently service upward of $1 billion in commercial loans in 22 states.

                        annual property inspections/financial reporting requirements, remit your tax/insurance
                        payments, and handle any other issue or problem that needs to be addressed.
